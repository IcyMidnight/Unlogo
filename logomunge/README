REQUIREMENTS
=======================

boost::filesystem
boost::program_options

USAGE
=======================

logomunge logos/Adidas

This will:

1. loop through all of the images in /logos/Adidas.  Each image will be considered to be a "model", ie: a straight-on representation of the logo

2. look for a folder of the same name, eg: if there is an image called variant-1.jpg, logomunge will look for a folder called variant-1 that contains examples of the logo "in the wild"

3. Each example will be analyzed and the descriptors will be combined into a single file and saved as 'descriptors.xml' into the original directory.  



TO DO
=======================

1. Make sure there are no duplicate images??

2. Pre-process images (Soebel?)

3. Only look for keypoints in area defined by "corners"
