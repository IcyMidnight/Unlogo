INTRODUCTION
----------------
moustachizer is a video filter that uses Haar Cascades in OpenCV to add moustaches to faces in a video.  It isn't really meant to be a tool for the public.  I am making it just to create videos as a reward for contributors to my Kickstarter campaign for Unlogo. But maybe it will be helpful for others.


REQUIREMENTS
----------------

OpenCV 2.2 - http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
FFMPEG compiled with vf_plugin.c

vf_plugin.c is a simple framework that allows you to specify a dylib or .o file to use as an avfilter in FFMPEG.  It basically saves you the trouble of having to recompile FFMPEG every time you make a change to your filter.  Perhaps future versions fo the moustachizer/Unlogo will just be a self-contained avfilter, but for development, this is the way to go*.

1. I start with the v0.6.1 tag from the git repository

git clone git://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg
git checkout v0.6.1

2. add vf_plugin.c to the libavfilter folder

cp [this folder]/libavfilter/vf_plugin.c [your ffmpeg clone]/libavfilter

3. modify '[your ffmpeg clone]/libavfilter/allfilters.c' and [your ffmpeg clone]/libavfilter/Makefile to include vf_plugin (see examples in [this folder]/libavfilter)

4. Then just ./configure, make, make install as usual

* The frei0r video filter framework is similar (but much more sophisticated) to vf_plugin.c, but I couldn't get it to work at all.


EXAMPLE USAGE
---------------
ffmpeg -i movies/FullHouse.mp4 -qscale 2 -vf frei0r=moustachizer -y out.mov
