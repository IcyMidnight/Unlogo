REQUIREMENTS
===============
- OpenCV


INSTRUCTIONS
================

* The version of FFMPEG included with this package includes the 'plugin' AVFilter. I recommend compiling it with --prefix=../ and installing everything into the main driectory, But you can also just install it into your system as usual.

* To compile FFMPEG

./configure --arch=x86 --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --disable-doc

* The directory 'ffmpeg' includes the plugin filter. To compile it just run
  /configure as usual.

* The directory 'vfilter_plugin' includes the implementation of the logo 
  detection filter. OpenCV needs to be installed to compile it.

bin/ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i share/videos/IMG_0092.MOV -vf plugin=./logo.so:./share/logos/Dior.jpg -y out.mov
