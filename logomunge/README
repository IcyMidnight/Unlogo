boost::filesystem
boost::program_options

USAGE
=======================

logomunge -r -d ../logos/Adidas

This will:

1. loop through all of the images in ../logos/Adidas and calcualte SURF keypoints and descriptors and save them to ../logos/Adidas.data

2. (Because of -r), loop through all of the subdirectories of ../logos/Adidas and save similar data to ../logos/Adidas/[subdirname].data

These data files will be used by the Unlogo filter to find logos in a video.

=======================

1. Make sure there are no duplicate images??

2. Pre-process images (Soebel?)

3. Only look for keypoints in area defined by "corners"
