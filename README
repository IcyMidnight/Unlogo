REQUIREMENTS
===============

- OpenCV: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

	svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv -r 3513
	cd opencv
	sudo cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
	sudo make
	sudo make install

- libANN:  http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/

	direct link: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/Files/1.1.2/ann_1.1.2.zip

- libsiftfast: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsift 

- pkg-config


OSX NOTES
================

- Unlogo uses a lot of bleeding-edge stuff. Update your MacPorts!

	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port upgrade outdated

- When compiling libANN for OSX, it might complain 'libtool: unrecognized option `-static`'.  This is because of a Macports/Fink issue.  Just open the Makefile and change this:

	"MAKELIB = libtool -static -o " \
to this
	"MAKELIB = /usr/bin/libtool -static -o " \

- Even with this fix, you will get an error in 'rand.cpp'.  Ignore this and move the lib and include files into your system.

- On OSX, use 'cmake -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF .' to configure libsiftfast.  

== OpenCV Notes ==

- You might need to change line 55 in both opencv/modules/gpu/src/constantspacebp_gpu.cpp and opencv/modules/gpu/src/beliefpropagation_gpu.cpp from 

	void cv::gpu::StereoBeliefPropagation::operator()(const GpuMat&, const GpuMat&, GpuMat&, const Stream&) { throw_nogpu(); }
to

	void cv::gpu::StereoBeliefPropagation::operator()(const GpuMat&, const GpuMat&, GpuMat&, Stream&) { throw_nogpu(); }

- In opencv/modules/gpu/src/matrix_operations.cpp, comment out line 71 -- the function doesn't exist.

	void MatPL::get_property_device() { throw_nogpu(); }



INSTRUCTIONS
================

The Unlogo filter uses the 'plugin' AVFilter for FFMPEG written by Kashif Balil.  This greatly simplifies and speeds up the process of making an AVFilter by allowing the user to reference a shared object when running FFMPEG rather than building the functionality into FFMPEG and having to recompile all of FFMPEG with every change. So the first thing you need to do is compile a version of FFMPEG with the 'plugin' filter.   Note:  Libavfilter is only available in the 0.6 branch. Older version of FFMPEG will not work. 

- Run checkout.sh

	./checkout.sh

- Configure and build FFMPEG as you normally would. Google is full of tutorials of how to build FFMPEG on your particular platform.  This works for me:

	cd ffmpeg
	
	./configure --arch=x86 --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --disable-doc --prefix=../

	make
	
	make install

- Now make logo.so by running 'make' from the root directory.  Make sure you've already installed the requirements listed above

- You're done!  To use the filter, make sure to use the version of FFMPEG that you just built, and then do something like this: 

	ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i [input video] -vf plugin=logo.so:[logo image] -y [output file name]

	ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i share/videos/IMG_0092.MOV -vf plugin=./logo.so:./share/logos/Dior.jpg -y out.mov
